      <description>Welcome! My name is Quinn Navara, and I am a sophomore at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln studying sports media. I&amp;rsquo;m originally from Treynor, Iowa where I played four sports. I played basketball, baseball, soccer and ran cross country. Sports has always been a big part of my life, and my passion for it continuously grows. This blog is for my Sports Data Analysis and Visualization class.</description>
